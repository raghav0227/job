            Engineering jobs are all about applying scientific principles to solve problems and create things. Engineers use their knowledge of math, physics, and other sciences to design, develop, build, and test a wide variety of things, from tiny circuits to massive bridges.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li><b><u>Design: </b></u> This involves coming up with ideas for new products, systems, or processes. Engineers will consider things like functionality, safety, and cost during this stage.</li>
            <li><b><u>Devlop:</b></u> Once a design is finalized, engineers turn it into a reality. This may involve creating prototypes, writing technical instructions, or overseeing construction.</li>
            <li><b><u>Build: </b></u>Many engineers are involved in the physical creation of things. This could involve working on assembly lines, managing construction projects, or installing equipment.</li></ul>
            <ul>
                There are many different types of engineering
                <br>
                <li><b><u>Civil Engineering: </u></b>Deals with designing and building infrastructure, like roads, bridges, and dams.</li>
                <li><b><u>Mechanical Engineering: </u></b>Focuses on designing and building machines, from engines to robots..</li>
                <li><b><u>Electrical Engineering:  </u></b>Works with electricity and electronics to create things like power grids and computers.</li>
                <li><b><u>Chemical Engineering:   </u></b>Applies chemistry to design processes for things like creating new materials or refining oil.</li>
